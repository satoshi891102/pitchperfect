## First Comment Draft
"Hey PH! I'm the builder behind PitchPerfect. 

I kept seeing founders spend weeks on pitch decks or pay $5K for consultants. The structure of a good pitch deck is actually pretty formulaic — so I built a tool that generates one from your business inputs.

The financial projections use real growth assumptions by stage (3x for pre-seed, 2.5x for seed, etc.). Market sizing is calculated from industry benchmarks. Competition is plotted on a 2D matrix.

Everything runs in your browser — no data leaves your device.

Would love your feedback on what would make this more useful!"
